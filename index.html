            The Great Southern Brood (Brood XIX) is a group of cicadas that
            emerge every 13 years across the southern United States. Brood XIX
            is arguably the largest (by geographic extent) of all periodical
            cicada broods, with records along the east coast from Maryland to
            Georgia and in the Midwest from Iowa to Oklahoma.
            <br /><br />
            They are known for their bright red eyes and loud buzzing sound. The
            cicadas spend most of their lives underground as nymphs, feeding on
            tree roots. When they emerge as adults, they shed their exoskeletons
            and spend a few weeks mating and laying eggs before dying. The next
            generation of cicadas will then burrow into the ground and begin the
            cycle again.
